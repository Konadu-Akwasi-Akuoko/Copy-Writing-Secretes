You need to create great copy because being good at sales copy helps you with content creation—speeches, webinars, Facebook Live, everything you’re going to do. The ability to create copy spills over into all these areas and helps you sell more.

## Develop A Copywriting Mindset

If you want to get good at copy, I’ll tell you the best way to get good at copy fast. It’s like getting good at pull-ups or getting into shape. First, you have to commit. Second, you have to practice. Third, you have to do it every single day . . . even when you don’t feel like it. It’s not something you turn on and off. It is something you become. You have the copywriting mindset. That’s how you do it. It’s commitment, practice, and  doing it every single day.

Commit to getting good at it. Then do it and practice it. Before you can be great, you have to be good. Before you can be good, you have to be bad. Before you can be bad, you have to try. You have to do something. Then you need to pay attention to and measure your results. What’s working and what’s not? It’s just like with working out. I can tell you for the last six years every rep, every push-up, every mile down to the second how long it took me to run each one and the total number of exercises, circuits and everything else. Why? You have to be able to measure your progress and results in order to improve your results moving forward.

Next, you do what works and stop doing what doesn’t. The only way you’re going to know the difference is to do a bunch of it. The great thing about the web, social media, and cheap traffic, you get feedback not in weeks, not in months, not even in days. You get feedback instantly whether what you’re doing is working or not. This is a fantastic opportunity to get good at copywriting just because you can get so much feedback so fast.

The other way to get good is to learn with your wallet. I’m not telling you to spend a ton of money on courses on how to write copy. I want you to pay attention to the copy that either makes you spend money now or in the past. Think about it. If the copy in someone else’s funnel, video sales letter, or Facebook video makes you spend money, you need to dissect that. You need to learn which sales messages work on you and why.

Even though it’s a process of developing and keeping that copywriting mindset, you can hack the process. Here’s how: do it in stages. You don’t need to master everything. But you need to do certain things in a specific order.

- First Step: Become great at creating headlines.
- Second Step: Become good at writing bullets.
- Then you need to get really good at calls to action and explaining and framing offers.

Summary:

- Develop the copywriting mindset in all you do.
- Master your headlines first because they will make the biggest impact on your sales copy the fastest.
- Pay attention to sales copy that gets you to spend your own money. That’s good copy!
- Never stop learning. Never stop observing. Never stop testing your sales copy.
