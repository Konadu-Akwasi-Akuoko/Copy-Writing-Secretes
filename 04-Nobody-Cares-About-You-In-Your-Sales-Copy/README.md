# Secret # 4 - Nobody Cares About You In Your Sales Copy

> “People aren’t interested in you. They’re interested in themselves.” - Dale Carnegie

People don’t care about you; they only care about themselves. They don’t care about you. Seriously, they don’t. Think about when you buy stuff or pay money. What do you care about? Be honest. You care about getting your money’s worth. You care about getting what was promised. You care about getting it when you want it. You care about it meeting your needs. You care about all the things related to the product and how it impacts you.

Look for these words in your copy: `“I, me, my, we, ours.”`

Why do you want to look for those words? Those words show where you’re talking about yourself. These are the words your prospects don’t care to hear because when you use them you’re usually not telling them things that will benefit them.

Just go back through your copy, look for any time you’ve used the words “I, me, my, we, ours,” and change the perspective. Change the verbiage. Example: “I want to tell you something here.” Changed perspective: “Here’s something you need to know,” or, “There’s something you need to know in this situation.”

It sounds overly simplistic, but it’s not. People don’t want to hear about you. They want to hear about themselves. They want to be the hero of your sales message. Not you. They want to picture themselves getting the results, not you.

And the way you do this is to convert your copy from talking about yourself to talking about them. How will they be enriched? How will they benefit? How will they receive what they want? Search through your copy. Look for “I, me, my, we, ours.” Then rephrase, rewrite, and reposition to use the words “you, your, and yours” instead.

In summary, the choice of pronouns in a sales copy should be guided by the goal of making a connection with the reader and making the copy feel relevant and engaging to them. It’s not about the pronouns themselves, but how they’re used to achieve these goals.

Summary:

- Make your sales copy all about them (your prospect).
- Go back through your copy and look for the words I, me, my, we, ours. When you find those words, change the perspective so it’s all about them—not about you.
- Remember: prospects don’t care about you. They care about having their needs met, their problems solved, their fears calmed, and their desires satisfied.
