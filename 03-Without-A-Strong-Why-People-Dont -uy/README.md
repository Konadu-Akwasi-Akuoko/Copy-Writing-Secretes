# Secret #3 - Without A Strong Why, People Don’t Buy

> People don’t buy without a reason why. - Jim Edwards

This is the single most valuable secret I ever learned. In my opinion, this is the one that can change your life the fastest. Burn this into your brain. People don’t buy without a reason why. Say it with me, “People don’t buy without a reason why.”

## There are ten reasons people buy

Here are the ten reasons people buy:

- Make money
- Save money
- Save time
- Avoid effort
- Escape mental or physical pain
- Get more comfort
- Achieve greater cleanliness or hygiene to attain
- better health
- Gain praise
- Feel more loved
- Increase their popularity or social status

The first five—make money, save money, save time, avoid effort, escape pain—resonated with me so well I committed them to memory. Those are the pegs people use to justify their buying. These are their why.

The key here is to tie multiple reasons to why people buy, not just one. Think about it this way: it’s like tying down a tarp in a windstorm. If you tie down one corner of it, it’s going to blow all over the place and not be under control. But, if you tie it in two, three, four, or five locations, suddenly it’s right where you want it. You do this by asking certain types of questions about your product and getting creative with the answers.

## Questions you can ask about your product

1. What are five ways my product or service will help them make money?
2. How can I or my product or service help them save money over the next week, month, or year?
3. How much time can I save them and what else could they do with that time?
4. What is something they don’t have to do anymore once they get my product or service? (This is how you figure out how it helps them avoid effort.)
5. What physical pain do I eliminate for them and what does that mean for their life and business?
6. How does my product or service eliminate mental pain or worry for them?
7. What are three ways I or my product can help them feel more comfortable?
8. How does my product or service make it easier for them to achieve greater cleanliness or hygiene?
9. How does my product or service help them feel more healthy or more alive?
10. What are three ways my product or service is going to help them be the envy of their friends and feel more loved by their family?
11. How will buying my product make them feel more popular and increase their social status?

Now, here’s how to put this on steroids. Force yourself to come up with ten answers to each of those questions. Your brain immediately exploded at this thought, didn’t it? I learned a problem-solving technique from a mentor of mine years ago. He said, “Take the problem you’re trying to solve and write it at the top of a piece of paper. Then write solutions to fill up the entire piece of paper. Then go to the next page and fill that page up.”

The easy answers come in the first third of the page. Then once you’ve exhausted the easy solutions, you need to dig in and start solving your problem and thinking outside the box. It’s those answers that come later in the process that contain the real solution. If you answer each question even five times, you’ll see answers that aren’t obvious.

Once you go beyond those two, three, four easy answers to each question, you start digging in and thinking about who your target audience is, what they want and where they are in their life. That’s where you’re going to come up with copy bullets that once you write them, you’re going to think, “Oh my gosh. That’s awesome. That’s going to make a huge difference.”

## How do you use this secret? How do you use this list?

You can tie these reasons to your offers, to your headlines, to your stories, to your bullets, to your content topics, to your calls to action, to everything. It’s a lens through which everything gets focused. It’s all based on that. Because once you understand the why or the whys, you can tie stuff to it that you wouldn’t ordinarily, and your competitors don’t.

## Here are a few examples

- Protein Shake. How could we apply the ten reasons people buy to a protein shake?
  - Make money: Drink this protein shake in the morning and you will have a fantastic amount of energy. You will do better at your job and probably get a raise.
  - Save money: Our protein shake is 25% less expensive than the market leader, but it has superior ingredients.
  - Save time: With our protein shake, you can have a nutritious breakfast in 30 seconds. You can spend more time with your kids before rushing out the door. This reason also ties in with feel more love.
  - Avoid effort: You have your breakfast made in 30 seconds and it’s delicious.
  - Escape physical or mental pain: Don’t you hate feeling bloated all the time when you eat too much breakfast? Or, what about feeling like you’re starving because you skipped breakfast? This shake solves that problem for you.
  - Get more comfort: I don’t know how this would help you get more comfortable unless it helped with constipation.
  - Achieve greater cleanliness or hygiene and better health: When you drink this protein shake, you won’t have bad breath when you show up at the office. Drinking this protein shake every morning is proven to help you lose weight and look great in your jeans.
  - Gain praise and feel more loved: You save time in the morning that you can spend with your family.
  - Be popular or increase social status: You lose weight. You look great. Think of all the new friends you’re going to make.

- Executive coaching program. It’s easy to tie it to making money.
  - Make money: Whatever you’re teaching a person will help them do better in their job, get a promotion, or get recruited by another company.
  - Save money: You could spend twice as much on consultants to help you do this, but we’re going to teach you how to do it.
  - Avoid effort: You don’t have to figure this stuff out on your own. All you have to do is do what we tell you to do using our proven templates and you’re good to go.
  - Escape physical or mental pain: What could an executive who’s looking to do executive coaching be trying to do that would cause physical or mental pain? Spending too much time at the office and neglecting their family. Interesting how we tie mental pain to love and familial status. Where are they feeling pain mentally or physically? When they’re spending too much time at the office and not able to spend time with their family and Little Timmy’s starting to call the UPS guy “daddy.” That would suck.
  - Get more comfort: Attend our executive coaching program where the top 1% of achievers enjoy all the benefits of having that corner office at a Fortune 500 company.
  - Attain fuller health: We’re going to show you not only how to excel in your job, but also how to find balance in your life once and for all.You can manage your health and energy to be even more of a high performer.
  - Gain praise and feel more loved: We’ll show you how to organize your time, so you are not staying at the office until ten every night. You’ll be able to go home and keep little Timmy from calling the UPS guy “daddy.”

- Dog training book.
  - Save money: I would start here. Learn how to train your dog yourself and avoid paying $50 an hour to somebody who probably isn’t a certified professional.
  - Avoid effort, escape pain: Avoid the issue of dealing with a dog bite either to yourself or a neighbor. Now, you could amp that up. Escape the potential pain of a lawsuit if your dog bites somebody. Don’t get sued. This book will help you to train your dog correctly and control aggression. “Oh, dang, I better buy that because I don’t want to lose my house because little Fluffy bit the neighbor’s kid.”

You can apply these reasons *why* to anything. Once you understand the reasons why, your job is simply to tie as many of them as you can to your product, service, software, or whatever it is. You must identify the reasons why people buy your stuff, specifically more than the obvious ones everybody else uses. You need to tie your product to as many reasons why as you can. Get creative. Get silly. Get inspired. Do something that relaxes you and let your mind run wild.

Summary:

- Commit these ten reasons why people buy to memory.
- Use as many of them as you can in your copy to “tie down” the prospect.
- Don’t fall into the trap of always making it about making or saving money.
- Get creative in how you use these reasons . . . make yourself stretch!
