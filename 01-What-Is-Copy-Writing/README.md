# Secret #1 - What Is Copy Writing

> "Sales copywriting is anything intended to persuade the right reader, viewer, or listener to take a specific action." - Jim Edwards

Whether online or offline, these specific actions you want them to take include clicking a link, making an inquiry for more information, buying something, or going on to the next step in your sales process like even liking a post, or sharing your post, or in short letting users take a specific action.

Sales copy can include anything from three-line newspaper ads to 40 page sales letters posted on the web. Thirty-minute infomercial videos, Facebook posts, Instagram posts, and anything in between can and should be considered sales copy.

If you want to get good at sales copy, you’re saying you want to get good at enticing people to do what you want them to do, like click links, fill out forms, like posts, share posts, and spend money.

## What makes copywriting different from regular writing?

Most people believe copywriting is a different way of thinking and writing. It’s very distinct with specific patterns. Sometimes these people are right. Other times they’re completely wrong.

The best copywriting occurs when people don’t realize it’s copy because it’s interesting to them.

For example back in the days, Jim used to read sales letters that came in the mail otherwise known as “free reports.” And this is what he has to say about it: *"It’s funny to think that back in the day, you would request a free report. It was nothing but a 10, 20, or 30 page sales letter. Because it was on a topic that interested you, you didn’t see it as sales copy. You saw it as a free report."*

When people are interested, they’re going to read it and not think about the fact that it’s trying to sell them something. Now, what makes people pay attention? What makes people read and not think about the sales message? Your content addresses their fears. It speaks to their desires. It uses the words they use. It feels like a conversation with a friend or a trusted advisor.

**People take action or buy when they feel like something will make them feel better or help them get what they want.** Why? Because it uses familiar, comfortable words. Again, sales copy is like a conversation with a friend or a trusted advisor.

## Copywriting comes down to intention

What do I want someone to do as a result of reading, watching, or listening to what I’ve created? With that in mind, sales copy can be a tweet. It can be an article. It could be a content video. It could be a Facebook Live video. It can be a meme. It can be anything you put in front of a targeted prospect. You put value in front of them. Then you invite them to take the next step which is to buy the stuff they want to buy anyway.

## How much has the art or science of copywriting changed over the years?

The way people talk has changed. They don’t talk the same. People have the same amount of time as they did 200 years ago, but they have a hundred more things fighting for their attention like social media, regular mail, TV, radio, communication devices like text, Instant Messenger and cell phones. These things compete for a finite amount of a person’s attention span.

 People have more things fighting for their attention. It’s important to understand this with your copy. In today’s world you must use a lot more curiosity to stop people in their tracks and get them to pay attention to you. Also, there’s a lot less buildup before you must get to the point.

Back in the days you needed to do a bit of warm up *(Hey, how’s the family? What’s going on? Talk about the weather, talk about politics, talk about the neighborhood, talk about this, talk about that.)* before you get to your sales copy, but today when it comes to copywriting, you’ve got to dispense with a lot of the warm-up. Instead, you grab them, get their attention with curiosity, and then drive them to the point you’re trying to make.

## How has copywriting stayed the same?

People are people who want to buy. You must have the attitude that if people understand the benefit of your product, service or software, they’re going to buy it. It’s your job as the person creating the copy to be a great communicator about why they need what you have. It’s your responsibility.

People have hopes, fears and dreams. They’ve always had hopes, fears and dreams, and they will continue to have hopes, fears and dreams. They love things. They hate things. They have opinions. The better you understand the people in your niche market, the more money you’ll make and the happier they’re going to be because your can communicate better with them.

## Understand your niche audience

 When people talk about copywriting, writing ads and targeting, they talk about their niche. And their niche is the **people**.

But, most people talk about numbers. They speak of psychographics or demographics. Often, they forget that people in the niche actually are the niche. You need to understand the people. It’s good to know the numbers and all that other stuff, but you need to understand the people, the person, the individuals in your niche.

Understand these are people with hopes, dreams and worries. They are just like you. They want time off. They want to take care of their children. They worry about the future. They stress out over their credit card bills. They want to have a nice car. They want to provide a great future for their family. All these things are important to them. You need to know what’s important to them because you’re selling to people. You’re not selling to a niche.

## In copywriting, there’s no prize for second place

Your copy either works or you starve. You don’t go halfway with your copy. You don’t do something just to see what happens and maybe it’ll work out. No. You put forth a strong effort every single time.
